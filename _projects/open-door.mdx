<div>
I love working with data, and that was largely the inspiration behind this site. I thought it could be
a culimination of where all the data could be analyzed that were relevant to me as a student: housing?
food? gyms? I was also navigating the concept of budgeting my entire life as a first-year university 
student, and thought that if there was some way ML could help me accomplish this task, I should build it!
