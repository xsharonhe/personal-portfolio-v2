My <a href="https://github.com/xsharonhe/personal-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first attempt at a personal portfolio</a> came at the end of 2020 in preparation for
the winter term when I would search for my first co-op term. Back then, I used Gatsby
with TypeScript, but it taught me a lot about looking for research ideas on Dribbble
and other software developers I looked up to, and building a portfolio website from scratch.

I wouldn't say it looked terrible, and it worked on both laptop and mobile platforms, but I thought it lacked an identity.
It looked generic to me, and I think I didn't show enough of my design skills or who I was. 
I love critical thinking and reflection, and after seeing <a href="https://www.seanhalpin.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Sean Halpin's website</a> (especially his WIP and project sections), I was inspired to redesign my
personal portfolio. I wanted not to only be able to showcase projects, but my thinking and process
behind the scenes (only if the user cared to know).


I went through a lot of sketches, designs, and asking my friends for design feedback. The puzzles
inspiration honestly came from doing a lot of puzzles and math problems this summer, and I thought
that perfectly showcased who I was. My logo was an attempt at writing my initials (S.H.) as puzzle 
pieces from the inspiration of one of my friends (and her Facebook Messenger drawings). I don't think that
is obvious to a stranger at first glance, but I think it conveys the puzzle theme well.

I chose to build my website with NextJS mainly because I was using it for 
the <a href="/projects/pump-redesign">PuMP website</a>, and I thought it would be a good way to get
more hands on experience with the framework (Gatsby, vanilla JS, Hugo, Jeykll were all other good options).
I also thought I could maintain the website more easily through HashiCorp's ```next-mdx-remote``` package where I could
write all about my projects in Markdown rather than playing with the framework over
and over again (and it's better for scalability).

Through this process, I learned a lot about this framework, CSS (pseudo elements, transitions,
animations), and finicking with Illustrator. I'm very happy with how the website now looks, and
I think it's a better representation of who I am and what I want to work towards. As much
as I love React, I don't think I will end up specializing in front-end development, but I still 
think this process showed me how important good design is for a website.
