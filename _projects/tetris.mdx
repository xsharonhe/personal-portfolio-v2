I am not much of a gamer, but when I did play games you could often catch me playing Tetris. One of the biggest aspects
of this game that I disliked was that most of the UI interfaces for Tetris were poorly designed, and so I thought
I could recreate a version of Tetris that focused on improving this aspect. I had just come out of using <code>Bootstrap</code>,
and disliked using it at times due to the lack of customization and its bulkiness, and so for the styling I used <code>Bulma</code>, as it was seen as a lightweight alternative.

        <figcaption>Playing tetris</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

It was one of my first projects in <code>JavaScript</code>, and I think it taught me a lot about why frontend frameworks
exist to make creating frontend components more easily. It reduces the need for <code>innerHTML</code>
or <code>createElement</code> and makes the focus more modularity.

**Side note**: The scary fast level is actually really difficult / probably impossible and it was fun getting my parents
to try playing Tetris on that level.
