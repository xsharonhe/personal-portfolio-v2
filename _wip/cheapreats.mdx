Six months ago, I landed my 
first software engineering internship at a start-up company.

<p>
Most people have awful things to say about unpaid internships,
but I found mine to be extremely rewarding. I learned so much 
about&nbsp;
<a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
atomic design
</a>, how to build and design software in a team (like not submitting
1000 lines for a PR review), and working with designers and the design process.
I met people of all ages from all over North America, and got to feel what it was like to
work in a start-up environment.
</p>
<p>
I am extremely grateful to my mentor(s) and team members, who all pushed me to learn new 
skills and do better. From this experience, the biggest takeaway I had was to gain the courage to ask questions. I think often times
it always feels as if we are bothering the senior engineers, but in reality, you get your work
done quicker and you're learning, which makes everyone happier.

This experience reaffirmed many things for me. I love to problem solve. I love 
working with a knowledgeable team, and I love building products.
