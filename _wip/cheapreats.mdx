<p>
After learning how to code for four months (besides the
one course in CS I learned in high school), I landed my 
first software engineering internship at a start-up company.
After six months, I finally finished today.

Most people have awful things to say about unpaid internships,
but I found mine to be extremely rewarding. I learned so much 
about&nbsp;

atomic design
</a>, how to build and design software in a team (like not submitting
1000 lines for a PR review), and working with designers (and the design process).
I met people of all ages from all over North America, and got to feel what it was like to
work in a start-up environment.

I am extremely grateful to my mentor(s) and team members, who all pushed me to learn new 
skills and do better. I am proud of myself for putting in the hours needed, despite
navigating my way through the first term of university. 
</p>
<p>
From this experience, the biggest takeaway I had was to gain the courage to ask questions. I think often times
it always feels as if we are bothering the senior engineers, but in reality, you get your work
done quicker and you're learning, which makes everyone happier. It is a lesson I will take
in my future software work.
